We can use large amounts of text to create models that can identify emotions in text, translate languages, or even generate text like ChatGPT.

Going in the other direction, we can use the str() method to convert many objects to strings. This is very common, we often need to do it when we want to do some sting operation, like concatenation, on a non-string object. In general, if something non-string is asked to print, it will just work; if something non-string is asked to do something \"beyond\" just printing, like concatenation, it will need to be converted to a string first.\n",

The basic idea is to include placeholders in the string, which are then replaced by the arguments of the format() method. The placeholders are defined by curly braces: {}.

If you need to include a brace character in the literal text, it can be escaped by doubling: {{ and }}.\n",
