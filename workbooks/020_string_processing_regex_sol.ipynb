    "# Regular Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "A regular expression is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. Usually this pattern is then used by string searching algorithms for \"find\" or \"find and replace\" operations on strings. We can use this to define general rules to find or process strings in a certain way. For example, we can use regular expressions to find all email addresses in a document, or to find all dates in a document - simply by defining what we are looking for using regex notation. \n",

    "### Regex in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a built-in package called `re`, which can be used to work with Regular Expressions. The `re` package provides multiple methods to perform queries on an input string. Here are the most commonly used methods:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> <b>re.match()</b> - checks for a match only at the beginning of the string.</li>\n",
    "<li> <b>re.search()</b> - checks for a match anywhere in the string. </li>\n",
    "<li> <b>re.findall()</b> - returns a list of all the matches in a single step. </li>\n",
    "<li> <b>re.split()</b> - returns a list of strings split by the given pattern. </li>\n",
    "<li> <b>re.finditer()</b> - returns an iterator of all the match objects. </li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regular Expression Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "Using regular expressions in Python has several advantages:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> Regular expressions are standardized across languages and tools. Once you learn the syntax, you can use it with other languages and tools.</li>\n",
    "<li> Regular expressions are very powerful and can be used to perform complex matching operations on strings. </li>\n",
    "<li> Regular expressions are often faster than other string processing methods in Python. These functions tend to be optimized and are often implemented in a faster language like C behind the scenes. </li>\n",
    "<li> Regular expressions have a provable outcome - we can mathmatically prove exactly what a regular expression will return, which is hard to do with common code. In most cases, this isn't a big deal, but in some scenarios it is critical. For example, mission critical code that runs things like nuclear reactors or space shuttles often needs to be provable. This means that if you're ever blessed with the misfortune of being in algorithm desing classes taught be some of the nerdiest nerds that ever nerded, you can do a mathmatical proof of the algorithms in the code to show that the output will always be correct, no matter what. Since regular expressions are a strictly defined language, they can be proven to always return the same output for a given input - if we created the same processing in our own code, doing a similar proof would likely be far more complex. </li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regular Expression Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also some disadvantages to using regular expressions:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> Regular expressions can be difficult to understand. </li>\n",
    "<li> Regular expressions can be difficult to debug. </li>\n",
    "<li> Regular expressions can be difficult to maintain. </li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, if we are looking for patterns in text data, which is not an uncommon thing to do in data science, regular expressions are a very useful tool to use. This is likely to become more and more true in the future as text processing for large language models becomes more prevalent. "

    "### Regex Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions use a special syntax that is both fairly simple for basic things, and incredibly cryptic for some complex things. Regular expressions can be used like regular search terms, if we want to look for words or phrases, but they can also be used to define complex patterns in text. We can define patterns of what the \"shape\" or \"structure\" of the text we want to match, then rely on the regex tools to find those matches. \n",

    "\n",
    "Let's say we have a string, and we want to find a certain word in that string. We can use the `re.search()` method to do this. Let's look at an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "The `re.search()` method returns a match object if the word is found in the string. If the word is not found, it returns `None`. In this case, the word is found, so the match object is returned. The match object contains information about the match, including the start and end position of the match. We can use this information to extract the word from the string. Once the match is found, we can use the `group()` method or the indices of the match to return the matched word."

    "There's a more complete list of regex syntax here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Raw Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "We can define a pattern using a specially designated string, then insert that string into the regular expression functions to find matches. The string we use to define the pattern is called a \"raw string\", which allows backslashes without escape characters. We can define a raw string by putting a `r` in front of the string:\n",

    "<li> r\"[pattern_stuff_here]\" </li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the string we define what we are looking for, it can be an actual string as we did above, or it can use regular expression patterns to look for more complex things. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Square Brackets\n",
    "\n",
    "In regex, square brackets are used to define a set of characters to match. For example, the pattern `[abc]` will match any of the characters `a`, `b`, or `c`. We can use this to \"group\" any subset of characters that we want. We can also specify ranges of characters using a dash. For example, the pattern `[a-z]` will match any lowercase letter from `a` to `z`. We can also use multiple ranges, for example `[a-zA-Z]` will match any lowercase or uppercase letter.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Word Boundaries\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the `\\b` character to match word boundaries. For example, the pattern `\\bcat\\b` will match the word `cat`, but not the words `caterpillar` or `bobcat`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Quantifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantifiers are used to specify how many times a character or group of characters can be repeated. For example, the pattern `a{3}` will match the character `a` exactly three times. We can also specify a range of repetitions, for example `a{1,3}` will match the character `a` one, two, or three times. We can also use the `*` character to match zero or more repetitions, and the `+` character to match one or more repetitions. For example, the pattern `a*` will match zero or more repetitions of the character `a`, and the pattern `a+` will match one or more repetitions of the character `a`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### \"Or\" Operator\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the `|` character to specify an \"or\" operator. For example, the pattern `a|b` will match either the character `a` or the character `b`. We can also use this to match a set of characters, for example `a|bc|def` will match either the character `a`, the string `bc`, or the string `def`. \n",
    "\n",
    "A useful shortcut when looking for something that is in a list of items is to use join and a list of keywords to create a simple search string. In the example below, we could use this to look for something that contains any of the words in the list. The pipe-join command can be inserted rather than constructing an actual search string - it will generate the proper string from the list we give it on the fly. For any vaguely realistic number of search terms this is fine, if we were looking to see if the text contained one of a massive number of terms, we'd likely want to calculate the search string in advance and store it in a variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Grouping\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use parentheses to group characters together. For example, the pattern `(a|b|c)xz` will match either `axz`, `bxz`, or `cxz`. We can also use this to group a set of characters that we want to repeat. For example, the pattern `(abc){2}` will match the string `abcabc`. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Group()\n",
    "\n",
    "The group() function returns the string matched by the re. We can use this to extract the matched string from the input string."
