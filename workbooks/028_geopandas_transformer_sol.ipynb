    "## What is an SKLearn Transformer?\n",
    "\n",
    "SKlearn transformers are classes that implement the `fit` and `transform` methods. They are used to preprocess data before feeding it to a model. In normal English, they are a step in data preparation pipelines that apply some type of clean-up step to the data. We use existing transformers all the time to impute, scale, or encode data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also write our own custom transformers by extending the `BaseEstimator` and `TransformerMixin` classes from the `sklearn.base` module. This is useful when we need to apply some custom transformation that is not available in the existing transformers. As long as we provide the needed functionality, our custom transformer can be used in the same way as the built-in transformers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## New - Pandas Got Better\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently, I think in 2023, the usability of the pipeline transformers was improved a bit by allowing them to work with pandas dataframes, not only arrays. Dataframes are much easier to use as a human, so this will make steps using and tailoring transformers easier. In the examples later in Machine Learning, we assume we need an array, so we make arrays before starting the pipeline. We now have more flexibility to keep the data in that dataframe format longer, so we can handle it through the pipeline process with more ease. "

    "## What's a Pipeline?\n",
    "\n",
    "A pipeline in sklearn is a sequence of steps that are applied to the data. In data science, we often need to load a large amount of data, and apply processing steps to that data in bulk to do things like impute, scale, or encode it. The pipeline is a way to automate this process so we can treat it as a group of steps, not a whole bunch of individual actions we need to manage bit by bit. \n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases, we will load our data, send it through the pipleline, and the output of that will go to the predictive modelling algorithm. All the preprocessing steps are done in the pipeline, so we can just focus on the model."

    "### Simple Pipeline Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple example of a pipeline - any data fed through this pipeline will have two steps applied to it - first the imputation (filling in blanks), then the scaling (making sure all the data is on the same scale). Each of these steps is a transformer - an object that we can make by extending some classes. These steps can be literally anything that we can imagine, as long as we meet the expectations of what a transformer needs (fit and transform methods) and we accept and return the data in the correct format.

    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> Name - this is how we refer to the step. When making more complex pipelines, we may need this. We can also grab a step by name. </li>\n",

    "</ul>\n",

    "Once created, it does those steps to that data in that order. This is really useful in a real life scenario where we likely have lots of data either in an incoming flow or regular batches to be processed. If we make a pipeline, then all the processing is handled there - we can capture the data in its original format and trust that our pipeline will do the right thing to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Note:</b> there are ways to have a smarter pipeline, that can do things like process part of the data in one way and part in another (like discreet and continuous data) - that uses the same pipeline framework, but with a couple of slightly more complex tools. "

You can also just google \"sklearn pipeline transformers\" and find one that you can try. For the most part, these are all related to preparing data for ML modeling, so the details aren't something we have worried about yet, but the act of using the transformers is identical no matter what they actually do.

    "There are a few ways to make a pipeline, and in general pipeline components can be connected together and swapped out as needed. This leans heavily on the duck typing pattern of thought we've been getting used to - we can swap things around, as long as it does what is required of it. "

    "## What Can Transformers Do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Pretty much anything you want, some common examples include:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> Imputing missing values </li>\n",
    "<li> Scaling numerical features </li>\n",
    "<li> Encoding categorical features </li>\n",
    "<li> Extracting features from text </li>\n",
    "<li> Reducing dimensionality </li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically anything we can express in a statement of \"change the data in this way\" can be a transformer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### And How Do They Do It?\n",
    "\n",
    "A transfomer is a pretty simple concept. It has two main methods:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> `fit` - This method is used to learn the parameters of the transformation. For example, if we are scaling numerical features, the `fit` method will calculate the mean and standard deviation of each feature. </li>\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "    <li> In many cases, the `fit` method does nothing, it just returns 'self', but it is still required to be there. </li>\n",
    "    <li> If we were imputing and inserting 'median' for missing values, this step would calculate the median of each feature. </li>\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "<li> `transform` - This method is used to apply the transformation to the data. For example, if we are scaling numerical features, the `transform` method will subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation. </li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these methods is automatically called by the sklearn pipeline when we insert them as steps. If we have any configuration, such as the number of features to extract or the method of scaling, we can pass these as arguments to the transformer's `__init__` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Making a Customized Transformer\n",
    "\n",
    "As long as we follow these expectations, we can make a pipeline step doing almost anything we want. We need to accept values in an expected format - a 2D array or dataframe, and return the values in that same correct format - the details can vary though, we can move, add, delete or change values, rows, and columns as we need. Each manipulation in the transform steps of transformers is basically a prescribed set of steps we could do to any spreadsheet of data. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Note:</b> the X copy thing isn't required, it is there as a safety thing to prevent accidental side effects. It's a generally good (or more accurately, safe) idea, but not a requirement. There's at least one solution below without it. The biggest risk here would be if you were to do something that changed the data in place, and then tried to use the original data later - for example, if your transformer has a sort, you don't want to accidentally sort the original data and then try to use it later. In normal usage in a pipeline, this isn't normally something that comes up. It is possible, and can be very confusing if it does. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Transformer TL;DR\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we can make a transformer to do anything we want, we just need to follow some constraints:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> We need to extend the BaseEstimator and TransformerMixin classes. </li>\n",
    "<li> We need to implement the fit and transform methods. </li>\n",
    "<li> We need to accept and return the data in the correct format - a 2D table in either DF or array. </li>\n",

    "## Geospatial Transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "With geospatial data, particularly for the things you're likely to be doing, these transformers and piplines can be used to make tools to process the data automatically into a format that provides what you need for analysis. We can create a pipeline that takes in raw data and outputs it in some format that we know we want - the steps to do those transformations are the transformers in the pipeline. Once built, we can process any new data with no additional effort by just running it through the pipeline - this means that we'd never do something like manually manipulate data in Excel or something like that, we'd always use the pipeline to do it for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "For your applications, you'll get some data and the format you need it in might vary, or you likely might need more than one format. For example, if you were displaying some data in Tableau or Power BI, you can take some raw data, run it through a pipeline that calculates whatever values need to be displayed, then output that as a datasource for your visualization. The transformer step might do all kinds of stuff like calculate distance, do spatial joins to get region labels, calculate area, etc... This data can then be fed to the visualization tool, and it can make pretty pictures without having to manipulate data there. There can be multiple pipelines (or outputs) that each prepares one central source of data, automatically, for different purposes.\n",

We don't want accidental changes, that are invisible, to the data behind our backs. In most cases, this won't be a real issue, but it is a very hard problem to trouble shoot if it does happen. </li>\n",

We want the same behaviour in most cases. This usually isn't that big of a stretch, most other functions that we might need will work with different data types already, so as long as we don't introduce some object-specific action, we should be ok. </li>\n",
