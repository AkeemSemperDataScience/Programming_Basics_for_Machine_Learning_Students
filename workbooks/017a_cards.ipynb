    "# Cards\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's make a poker game, or at least part of it. Our goal will ultimately be to create a game of 5 card draw poker. For now, we'll try to create a deck of cards, and hands for the players that inherit from the deck. So, we should have 3 classes for this stage: Card, Deck, and Hand:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> Card</li>\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "    <li> A card is one individual card, made up of a Suit and a Rank (ace, two, three...queen, etc...)</li>\n",
    "    <li> A card needs to provide str, lt, gt, eq to allow for comparisons and printing. </li>\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "<li> Deck</li>\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "    <li> A deck is made up of a bunch of cards. </li>\n",
    "    <li> A deck needs to be able to be initialized - here we want to fill it with 52 cards and potentially shuffle it.</li>\n",
    "    <li> A deck needs to have a str and len method override. </li>\n",
    "    <li> A deck needs to be able to deal out cards into smaller decks, of whatever number is requested. </li>\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "<li> Hand</li>\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "    <li> The hand class inheirits from the deck class and represents a \"mini-deck\" of five cards (we're building a 5 card poker deck for now, later on we'll change this\n",
    "    up a bit to make this into a five_card_poker deck, and that'll allow us to make other decks that inheirit from the Deck class but make sense for different games).</li>\n",
    "    <li> The hand needs to define a lt method, that can act to do a comparison for determining which had wins, in the context of poker. This can be wrong! We need a system for scoring that functions, we can make it poker-y later. </li>\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "Underneath the spot we have to make the classes, there is a bunch of stuff to test and see if it works is there. This testing is limited, we should try to create more to really test things here - if we are going to build this up into an actual game of poker (and we intend to), we should make sure that things work first, especially the edge cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Note:</b> a full game of poker, especially the part of calculating who wins, is actually reasonably complex. That part isn't really critically important, if we make some error in the calculation of which three of a kind tie-breaker <i>actually</i> wins, it isn't a big deal. The important point is that we can create a deck that works - even if there's some tiny error in the exact logic. We can always fix that later In reality, game logic errors are something we'd notice in user testing, where we would be actually playing to make sure it works, and at some point we'd see that the wrong player won some hand, and we'd have to go back and fix it. This is a bit of agile thinking, right now we're in sprint number one. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Design Choices\n",
    "\n",
    "While we make this, there are many choices that we need to make, and many of them don't have a super clear answer. This is normal and OK here. We want to focus on - what does it need to do? Can it do it? It is OK to have something that half works, we can revise. Some things to pay particular attention to are:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> Where something should \"live\" - there are lots of actions here that could be done by the deck, or the hand, or the card. We need to think about where it makes sense to put them. </li>\n",
    "<li> How to represent things - we could represent a card as a string, or as a tuple, or as a class. We could represent a deck as a list of cards, or as a class. We could represent a hand as a list of cards, or as a class. We need to think about what makes sense. </li>\n",
    "<li> How to do things - we could shuffle a deck by making a new deck and randomly drawing cards from the old deck and putting them in the new deck, or we could shuffle the deck in place. We could sort a hand by making a new hand and drawing cards from the old hand and putting them in the new hand, or we could sort the hand in place. We need to think about what makes sense. </li>\n",
    "<li> Constructing a new deck - we have different scenarios where a deck will be created, how do we want to handle that? </li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these things are somewhat open - we can make a choice that works, go with it, then change it if we encounter something that doesn't work. If our code is relatively modular, with well encapsulated classes and methods, we can change things without too much difficulty. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal For Now\n",
    "\n",
    "Right now we want to be able to have a deck, deal some hands out of it, and compare those hands to each other. The comparison part should be based on actual poker logic, but it is ok if that logic is incomplete or wrong - we just need some systemic way to compare hands and order them by their value. "

    "### Potentially Useful Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pop()\n",
    "\n",
    "An item can be grabbed from a list, and removed from that list, with the pop() method. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Random.shuffle()\n",
    "\n",
    "Random.shuffle() can be used to shuffle a list to random order. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Make an Iterable\n",
    "\n",
    "Our deck class should be an iterable - i.e. we should be able to loop through it like we could a list or other container. For a class to work as an iterable we need to define two methods:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> __iter__ </li>\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "    <li> Iter returns the iterator, or the object itself. </li>\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "<li> __next__ </li>\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "    <li> Next returns the next item. </li>\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "If we implement these two methods, we'll have an item that can work as an iterable. The iter method is simple, we just return the object. The next method is the bulk of the functionality, it needs to always provide the next item in the iterable. If there are no more items, it needs to raise a StopIteration exception. If we have an object that is holding its data in something like a list or tuple, we can do this pretty easily - just ask the existing container for its next item, and raise a StopIteration exception if there are no more items."
