    "# Basic Stats in Python and Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Note: I removed the \"updated\" from the title between class 1 and class 2, we'll look at pulling from my repository at the start of class.</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of file is called a notebook. They are commonly used in data science. \n",
    "These notebooks allow us to write code, execute code, and add webpage style text all in one spot.\n",
    "Each 'block' is called a cell. Markdown cells are like this one, they have text. Code cells are like the one below, that's where our code goes.\n",
    "The little play sign next to each code cell is how we run (execute) that bit of code. Any errors or results will print below that cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Import Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "The imports that we have here allow us to load external code packages that will help us do stuff. We can load things that will help us draw charts, make models, do math, etc...\n",
    "\n",
    "There's actually relatively little \"stuff\" that is part of a programming language like Python. Each of these libraries is a collection of functionality made by someone else that we can import into our programs and use as if we wrote it. For example, right now we are importing:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>Two from the maker of the text \"thinkstats/plot\", these provide us with some useful stats calculations as well as some easy graphing. \n",
    "<li>Pandas, which gives us dataframes - a data structure (thing that holds data) that is a kind of python-spreadsheet. \n",
    "<li>Numpy, which gives us some other common mathmatical functionality. \n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, when we want to do something different we'll need to load some of these libraries, which will give us the toolset without forcing us to make things from scratch. When we installed Anaconda, a bunch of these libraries were installed by default, these are the ones that we can import. There are other ones that we'll need to install before we can use them. Installing things can be done in a few ways, such as:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> Running \"conda install <name>\" from a terminal. \n",
    "<li> Running \"pip install <name>\" from a terminal. (We'll install pip now)\n",
    "<li> The GUI in Anaconda. \n",
    "<li> Using \"!pip install <name>\" in code. (This is useful later on in the ML class, when we use Colab)\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this stuff can differ, in annoying ways, from system to system - especially if you're using Windows. On a Mac it is relatively easier. You may get some weird errors or issues that need to be investigated and dealt with individually. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to pay attention to is that we can have different environments in which your python code can run. These environments can differ because they can each hold different stuff, such as different versions of python and different sets of installed libraries. For us, having different environemnts is not really very useful, if someone is developing real software it can be important because someone can build and test their program in one environment with a specific set of stuff, and know that as long as that environment is kept the same, this code can be used anywhere and should work fine. Things like updates to the kernel, changes to libraries (e.g. even a name change to a function will break things), or updates that break other things won't break our program because it is in one specific environment; if we wanted to update something, we can test it and fix issues in a controlled way. This is pretty analogous to something like the Windows or Mac updates pushed out to your computer, once in a while an update will break some installed program in some way; large companies generally stop these updates from happening automatically so they can test the changes, then they push out the update once they are clear it doesn't cause an issue. Here, developers can not update new changes to the environment until they have a chance to check and see that nothing breaks. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we are working on different types of projects, we can also have environments setup with all of their libraries installed and configured. For example, developing neural networks to do image recognition generally uses big sets of libraries that are useful for that specific application. We might have one environment for this, and another that has all of the stuff needed for out other work where we are processing text. I created a backup environment last year before I installed some libraries that might interact with others and cause issues. \n",
    "\n",
    "For us, we need to set the environment when we run code. We can see the environment in the upper right of the editor window. If we run code and nothing works, and we get messages that common stuff is missing, this is a likely culprit. "
