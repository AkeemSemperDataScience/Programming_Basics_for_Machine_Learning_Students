    "# Doing Things in Bulk\n",
    "\n",
    "We are, hopefully, pretty comfortable with the idea of looping through some data structure if we need to \"do something\" to every item in the structure. In addition to loops, there are other ways to accomplish this. These other ways are often more efficient, and they can also be more expressive - more readable and easier to understand. Again, efficiency is not a massive concern in most cases, but doing actions to datasets that may be millions of items long can be one of those cases. Expressiveness, on the other hand, is always a concern. The more readable and understandable our code is, the easier it is to maintain and the less likely it is to contain bugs. I personally have a lower opinion of the readability of these condensed shortcuts than most people, but that's really just an opinion. I also think that this is another good example of a scenario where we want to focus on what do to, then figure out how to implement it. If we know we want to take the square root of every item in a list, we can look up how to do that; if we write a loop and find it is inefficient or hard to debug, we can look for another solution then. One benefit of the type of programming that we do in data science is that we almost always test and observe our code in chunks as we write it, so if there's some chunk that is taking an inordinate amount of time we can then investigate as the need occurs - it is very unlikely that we will write things that take ages to run without noticing. \n",

    "### Lambda Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common tool, one especially useful for simple actions that we want to apply to a large number of items, is the lambda function. Lambda functions are single line functions that are anonymous, meaning they are not bound to a name. Lambda functions can accept arguments, but they can only contain one expression. Unlike functions created with the def keyword, lambda functions return an expression, not a value. They are useful for creating quick functions that aren't needed later in your code, for data science, this may often come up for things like preparing data that is largely unstructured - we may have several specific steps that we need to do once on some column of data, like splitting full names into first, last, and middle(s). \n",

    "lambda argument(s) : expression\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> lambda is a keyword in Python for defining the anonymous function.</li>\n",
    "<li> argument(s) is a placeholder, that is a variable that will be used to hold the value you want to pass into the function expression. A lambda function can have multiple variables depending on what you want to achieve. </li>\n",
    "<li> expression is the code you want to execute in the lambda function.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of what the lambda function is doing as:\n",
    "<ul>\n",

    "<li> Return the result. </li>\n",
    "<li> Repeat for each item in the data</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",

    "The lambda functions that we create work just like any other function, they are just more constrained and smaller. We can use them in the same way that we use any other function, including passing them as arguments to other functions.

We can do this with a for loop, but there are some other ways that are more efficient and more readable. In effect, rather than focusing on moving through the items in the dataset and doing something to each, these methods are oriented around defining what is to be done, and where that is to be applied.

    "Map doesn't return a list or another data structure of the results, it returns a map object - a type of iterable. Iterables as a concept are something that we'll explore in more detail later. For now, we can think of this as something that we can use like any other data structure, but we first must convert it to a list or other data structure if we want to use it like one. When we want to see the results above we wrapped the map in a list() function, which converted it to a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "The object itself is actually a type of iterator, or a variation on a normal data structure where the items inside are not stored in memory, but are instead generated as needed. This is something that we will see more when using large datasets for neural network models, where the amount of data is more than we can fit in the memory of the system, so we leave it on disk and only pull in bits at a time. The key concept here is that the iterator will return the next item when asked, no matter if that item is in memory or not. In a \"normal\" data structure all the data is in memory. This is also an example of \"lazy\" evaluation, where we don't do anything until we need to. Lazy evaluation is a common technique that we see in Python when working with large datasets, we can avoid doing large and slow operations in favor of distributing that work over time. These iterators also open the possibility of effectively infinite data structures, where we can generate the next item in the data structure as needed. Take an example of training a large language model such as chatGPT, where it will need to take in a massive amount of text as its training data. We can't fit \"the internet\" into memory, but we can create an iterator (specifically a <i>generator</i>) that will produce the next item that we expect, without forcing us to care about the data as a whole. \n",
