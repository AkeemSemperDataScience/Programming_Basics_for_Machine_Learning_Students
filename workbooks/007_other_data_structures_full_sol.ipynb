    "# Weird Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "While we normally think of and use data structures like lists - we have a bunch of stuff and we put it into some kind of order. In data science, this will usually be the case (along with dataframes and another container, arrays). Some situations and some problems are better suited to a much different type of data structure to hold the data. Here we'll look at a few data structures that are distinctly non-list-like."

    "## Unordered Collections - Sets and Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists and tuples are ordered collections of elements. We can access elements by their index that refers to the position of the element in the collection. Sets and dictionaries are different types of data structures, they still hold objects, but those objects do not have an order or positions. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Lies of New Python\n",
    "\n",
    "As of Python 3.7, sets and dictionaries are now internally ordered. This doesn't change how we think of them, as their benefits come from their unordered nature. It means that if we are iterating over the items in the data structure that the order will be consistent. We still don't use indexes to refer to items by position, but this makes the sets and dictionaries more consistent and interchangeable with other data structures. So, we'll talk about these data structures as if they are unordered, but they have had that change made to their internal workings to allow for more interoperability with other data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "So all the mentions of the order not being maintained are not technically true. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets are unordered collections of unique elements. Sets differ from lists primarily in that they are unordered and that they can only contain unique elements. We can make an empty set and add items, or we can create it from some other data structure (more on this in the dictionary bit).\n",

    "We don't use sets a lot in data science, but they can be useful for a few things. One is to remove duplicates from a list. Another is to find the unique elements in a list. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sets are immutable, so we can't change them once we've made them. We can add and remove items from them, but we can't change the items that are in them. This is similar to a tuple, and distinctly different from a list or a dictionary, where we can change things at will. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Set Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "We can make sets using the set() constructor or using curly braces; we can also make an empty one that we add to, or make it directly from some other data structure like a list. Items can also be added and removed from a set, and we can check and see if an item is in a set. Note that when we make a set from a list, we automatically filter out all the duplicates. "

This means that we can loop through its items using a for list, without having to really adapt our loop at all. This is one strength of the way things are designed as iterables in Python, we can create a function that loops through our data in a list, then use that same function on data that is stored in a dictionary, or a set, or any other iterable. Since dictionaries are now internally ordered in Python, we can expect the order of the items to be consistent - even though we aren't explicitly using those positions for referencing items. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Note:</b> this is also one example of something we commonly see in the syntax of Python, multiple return values. In this case, the for loop is returning two values, the key and the value. This is something that is common, a function can return more than one value, and we can \"take\" as many of those return values as we need. Commonly the \"main\" value is the first, and others follow. If we don't need them, we just leave them out. This is also an example where some simple design choices that we make can have positive or negative unintended impacts. By utilizing the common interface provided by the iterable data structures, our code can be more flexible and more easily reused."

They are commonly used to hold data that is waiting to be processed. Queues and stacks hold data in a way where we can only add items in one way, and remove them in another.\n",

    "A queue is a collection of objects that are inserted and removed according to the first-in, first-out (FIFO) principle. An excellent example of a queue is a line of people ordering at Burger King. New additions to a line made to the back of the queue, while removal (or serving) happens in the front. In the queue data structure, the oldest element is removed first.\n",

We'll look at an example of a stack when we look at recursion. Stack data types need to be imported from some external package, or we can make our own."
