    "    <li> Python is relatively easy to learn and use. Compared to other languages, it is very approachable. \n",

    "<li> Jupyter Notebooks - this one is behind the scenes. This file, and the others that we'll create and use, are called notebook files. These files are special because we can write code, run code, and add webpage like text and images all on one page. This makes it easy for us to do everything in one place. In practice, it is common to develop things in a notebook like we'll be doing, then export the final product to be used in a production environment. \n",

    "\n",
    "There is a little icon in the top right of the notebook that indicates which environment (a.k.a kernel) you are currently using. By default, Anaconda sets one up named \"base\" that has a bunch of useful default stuff in it. We generally want to use this one. Each of the libraries (things such as pandas) that we install will only \"exist\" in one environment - the one in which they were installed. As we go through the semester we'll add other libraries to do other stuff, if we try to run our code in an environment where that stuff doesn't exist, we'll get an error, since it can't find it. \n",

In \"real\" production environments we would probably still use notebooks just like ours to do the development, then export part (either a trained model or portion of code) into another format, which would then be integrated into the actual working systems. We are working entirely on that preparation part, so the last deployment step doesn't really matter to us. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you've ever programmed before you may have seen \"regular\" python programming in regular, non-notebook files, likely with a .py file extension. Those are created using the same Python language, but are intended to be run like a \"normal\" program (i.e. someone presses \"Run\" and the program goes) rather than in the interactive environment we are using here. The language is the same in those files and the code we write, outside of a handfull of commands that are special to either environment; if we want an example of something and we find it in a \"regular\" python file, that's still useful because it is almost certainly the same in our notebooks.

    "\n",
    "Another of our foundational tools is GitHub, and its component Git. Git and GitHub are tools that help us manage and store code, share it between multiple contributors, update versions, and package final products. It is effectively a file manager for programs being developed. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Note:</b> At some point in setting up VS Code you'll need to install Git (without the hub) for this part to start working. In the window on the left, there will be a link to \"Git\" at some point, click that and follow the directions. This part may differ depending on what you've installed on your machine before and if you're on a Windows or Mac, there may be instructions to install some other program along the way, just follow those directions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Like the other tools GitHub has a lot of capabilites, and we only need the basics. We'll use GitHub to:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> Share content with you, like this repository. I can give you the Github link for you to clone the repository, you then get a copy of the entire set of files. \n",
    "<li> Update changes. As we go through the semester I can update the files in this repository, and you can use the \"Pull\" command to automatically get all my changes. \n",
    "<li> Manage your work. You can save your work to your own GitHub repository and it will do things like track changes and versions for you. \n",
    "<li> Share with others. When there is more than one person working on a project, GitHub will manage changes made by different people to ensure that things stay in sync. \n",
    "<li> In more elaborate setups you can also use GitHub to do things like take in bug reports or run automated testing routines. \n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "GitHub is a very, very commonly used tool in industry. It can be a little bit of a headache initially, but it is definitely worth the hassle of learning how to use it. If you work in any programming related job there is a very high likelihood you'll use Git, or an alternative that does the same thing. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Actions\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few fundamental things we need to know and be comfortable with to use GitHub and be successful:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> Cloning a repository - you've all done this to get here, cloning a repository makes a copy of a code repository on GitHub and saves it to your computer. You can then work on it, and if you were in a real job you'd have other people working on the same repository at the same time. For assignments, you'll clone the repository I post that has your starting point in it, then start work on your copy. \n",
    "<li> Committing your changes - as you work on things like projects and assignments you can submit your progress into your own GitHub repository. Each time you submit changes GitHub will do a lot of work to maintain your code - versions will be archived, so you can roll back changes; if you are working with others, your changes will be merged; if your computer goes up in flames everything is saved online. \n",
    "</ul>\n",

    "\n",
    "There are lots of things that we can do in GitHub, but we'll mostly stick to relatively simple actions:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> Cloning a repository - you've all done this to get here. Take the link, go to the Source Control window, click Clone Repository, enter the link, and choose where to save it on your computer. When you do assignments you'll do this to download a repository that is your starting point. \n",
    "<li> Pull - update FROM the online repository TO your computer. As I make updates to these workbooks throughout the term, you'll regularly (before every class usually) perform a pull, or grab any changes and update your machine. In the source control window, click the 3 dot icon in the header and choose Pull in the menu. \n",
    "<li> Commit - push FROM your computer TO the online repository. As you work on an assignment, you'll want to regularly commit as you progress. Each time you do, that version will be logged on the server and backed up. In the source control window, click the check mark logo, enter a note for the update, and press enter. \n",

    "## Libraries and Installing Things\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing you'll see all the time in Python, and programming in general, are \"import\" statements littered about, especially at the top of a program. These import statements grab libraries - packages of code that other people have written, and include it in our program so we can use it. Most of the stuff that we use isn't part of the core of Python itself, they are things that were written, shared, and reused over and over. Some of the common ones that we'll spend time with right away are:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> Pandas - provides the dataframes that hold data. \n",
    "<li> Numpy - provides an assortment of math-like things, as well as arrays which we'll use later. \n",
    "<li> Seaborn - provides graphing and visualization functions. \n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "There is a near infinite list of other ones that may be useful, we generally want to use these things when they exist (outside of doing something for the purposes of learning about it), as published packages are generally tested, optimized, and maintained, so they'll normally function better than whatever we can write. Anaconda packages many of the common libraries into one bundle, so for most things we can just add an \"import whatever\" statement and use it. There are lots of things that Anaconda doesn't package, so if we need one of those things, we need to install it. This is usually a simple process, but may require some setup and config for your particular machine, especially if you're on Windows. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few ways we can install things, from easiest to most complex:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Install via Magic Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "We can write a special command in code that basically sidesteps python and runs a command on your underlying machine. We can add one of these at the head of a program that needs to install stuff, and it will run the installation if it is needed when you run the code. This is useful if you may be running code in different environments, such as running code in VS Code and Google Colab, as it will do the installation right up front. Again, there are two ways to install stuff here:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> Install using conda. Anaconda has an installer that we can run. \n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "    <li> !conda install PACKAGENAME\n",
    "    <li> E.g. to install pip - !conda install pip\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "<li> Insall using pip. Pip is the most common python installer, and if you see examples online they will normally use pip. You MAY need to install pip first to use it. I normally use pip\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "    <li> !pip install PACKAGENAME\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Install via Terminal Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also install things using the terminal. VS Code allows us to open a terminal inside the program, this is the same as if we opened a command prompt or terminal window on our computer. We can then run the same commands as above, but directly in the terminal. To open a terminal go to the Terminal menu and choose New Terminal. Once at the command prompt, we can use the same commands as above, just without the ! at the front.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Install via Anaconda GUI\n",
    "\n",
    "Packages can also be installed via the Anaconda GUI. This is the most user-friendly way to do it, but it is also the most manual and least repeatable so we won't focus on it much. The Anaconda documentation has a good guide on how to do it: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/tutorials/manage-packages/#:~:text=To%20install%20a%20package%20from,then%20click%20the%20Apply%20button. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Install via Requirements File\n",
    "\n",
    "We won't really do this, because it is more for production, but another common way to install needed stuff is to use a requirements file, which is just a text file with a list of needed libraries (and specific versions, if desired). An action can be setup to verifiy that all the requirements are met when testing/executing the code. For example, you could setup a repository on GitHub that ran a set of tests on your code when you check it in, and setup an environment with all the requirements in the process of doing so. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Potential Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few, machine specific things, that can go wrong or weird with this. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### PATH Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common issue is a need to add something to the PATH. The PATH is roughly something that defines what programs you can run by name - i.e. if you were to open a terminal and type \"Excel\" and hit enter, MS Excel would probably open. If you type \"conda/pip install whatever\" and there's an error that it is an unknown command or similar, this is likely the issue. The solution is generally simple, you need to edit a value in your OS's configuration. Google \"pip/conda add to path [my operating system version]\" and there should be a multitude of examples online showing you what to add with screenshots and even recordings. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to be attentive to in all this is the python environment. These installs are a per-environment thing, so an easy way to get confused is to install one in a different environment by accident. "
