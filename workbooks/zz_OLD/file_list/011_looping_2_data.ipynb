    "## Series\n",

    "A series is another data structure from pandas. A series can be thought of as roughly one column of a dataframe. In fact, if we slice a column from a dataframe, we get a series by default. Series are kind of like lists with much of the dataframe functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantages of using a series over a list are:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> Series have a type, like a column in a dataframe. </li>\n",
    "<li> Series are mutable, like lists, and can be changed in place. </li>\n",
    "<li> Series are iterable, like lists, and can be looped over. </li>\n",
    "<li> Series have some \"extra\" methods to accomplish common tasks. </li>\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "    <li> There are methods to get the mean, median, mode, etc as well as more elaborate ones like quintiles. </li>\n",
    "    <li> There are methods to deal with missing or 'dirty' data values. (e.g dropna, fillna, drop_duplicates). </li>\n",
    "    <li> There are interaction methods like head, tail, sample, etc. </li>\n",

    "![Series to Dataframe](../images/series_dataframe.png \"Series to Dataframe\")\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also declare a series using the constructor, pd.Series(), into which we can optionally pass another data structure, such as:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> List </li>\n",
    "<li> Dictionary </li>\n",
    "<li> Numpy array </li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "The documentation for Series from Pandas is reasonably clear: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Series.html \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using Series\n",
    "\n",
    "We use series largely like we'd use a list, and conveniently many functions that we use will work on both. For example, we can use the len() function to get the length of a series, just like we would a list. When manipulating dataframes we commonly get a series by default if we slice a column or do something resulting in a one column dataframe. We can also use a series if we want to use some of its extra functionality, like cleaning up the data or doing some statistical calculations. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the most part, we don't really have to use a series, other data structures will do just fine. In practice, we use them pretty often when doing data science work, either because it is what we end up with or because we want to use some of the extra functionality. A series is marginally more resource intensive than a list, but not enough to worry about. When dealing with machine learning we may use a series regularly because we are often dealing with data in dataframes, and a series fits directly into that model of thinking. "

    "### In-Place vs. Not In-Place\n",
    "\n",
    "Several methods that we use with a series have an \"in-place\" argument, which we can set to control if the original object is modified or not by a function call. By default, the in-place argument is set to False, meaning that the original object is not modified so we must capture the return value into a variable in order to keep it. \n",

    "\n",
    "For the most part, this difference won't impact your overall program at all, but it is an easy place to create a bug. As well, creating a new object can be expensive in terms of memory and potentially time, especially if we are dealing with large items like machine learning datasets. When our objects are large, we likely want to avoid creating new objects if we can. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Note:</b> It is rarely a concern with regular variables in data science work, as our programs aren't that large, but if you can imagine a program running on a server that stays active for weeks at a time, this can be an impactful memory leak. Python does have a garbage collector, or automated system to free memory from unneeded items, but it is not perfect and there can be scenarios where it doesn't capture all the items that are no longer needed."

    "## Enumeration\n",
    "\n",
    "Enumeration is another tool for looping through objects that are iterable. Enumeration can act as a sort of combo between a for and while loops - we automatically loop through every item without managing an index, like a for loop; we also get an index or counter, like a while loop. Enumeration is a function that takes an iterable as an argument and returns a tuple of the index and the item, so we can apply it in the same way for many different types of iterables. We call the enumeration function with enumerate(ITERABLE), and we can optionally pass a start value, which will be the value of the index for the first item. The enumeration returns a tuple of the index and the value, so we can capture both in a single variable, or we can capture them separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Enumeration](../../images/enumeration.png \"Enumeration\")\n",
    "![Enumeration](../images/enumeration.png \"Enumeration\")\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Note:</b> enumeration is seen fairly regularly when using large datasets for neural networks. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Enumerable Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use enumeration with any iterable data structure, including lists, dictionaries, series, and more, and it will work the same way. This gives us one additional layer of \"abstraction\" in our code - we don't need to worry about what the data structure is when using enumeration, as long as the data structure is iterable. This means we can swap out one data structure for another, and our code will still work. Yay for interchangeable parts!\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, looking forwards to machine learning, it isn't too uncommon to swap out data structures, particularly if we work with some small dataset to create something, then switch to a larger one later on. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Index and Value\n",
    "\n",
    "The enumeration always gives us both the index and the value when we are looping, which is convenient. In data science work we generally work with large datasets, and we also generally split and then recombine them back together, so the ability to manage where things are in a dataset is important. In particular, we may have data like images where the data is not in a tabular format, and we still need to track which image is which so we can align them with our predictions. Using enumeration will process through a dataset and maintain the index, so we can use that to align our data later."

    "There was one function that I used in mine that has a warning, due to being deprecated, or old. This block suppresses the warning so it doesn't pop up in the notebook and annoy me sensibilities. Warnings like this are somewhat common, when things change in libraries that we use, they typically plan for changes that will cause old code to fail for a long time. So if a method is going to be removed or drastically changed, the old one will be left in for a long time, but it will be marked as deprecated, or old, and a warning will be given. This is to give us time to update our code before the old method is removed."
