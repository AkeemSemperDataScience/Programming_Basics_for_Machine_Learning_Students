    "# Mo' Cards, Mo' Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "We can continue to build towards a functioning poker game here, and work to add additional features and logic bit by bit. Our starting point will be where we finished last time, with working Card and Deck classes that can be used to create and deal out cards. My first goals here are to:\n",
    "<ul> \n",
    "<li> Extend the Deck class into the Hand class. The Hand is meant to represent the cards held by a player, and will be used to determine the winner of a round of poker. To acheive this we need to add scoring logic to the Hand class. </li>\n",
    "<li> Create a basic Game class that will \"run\" the game. This should be able to create the Deck, deal Hands, give them to Players, and determine winners. As we add more logic, this will basically be the \"dealer\" or \"manager\" of the game and hold all the stuff for a game. This will probably require that we periodically make changes to what's in some of the other classes, as the way things work together will change a bit as we reform it into an actual game. </li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll try to get that framework working today, even if the internals are not fully functional or complete. If we have working scoring for some poker hands we can use that to build the rest, then go back and make our scoring logic handle more complex and obscure things later. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Deck Constructor\n",
    "\n",
    "One change that we will need to make is to the Deck class constructor. In particular, we want to be able to create a deck in two ways:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> Make it from scratch, with 52 cards optionally shuffled. </li>\n",
    "<li> Make it from some cards. </li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to add the second option, so we can make new decks as well as \"sub-decks\" from existing decks or cards. This will also be useful to make Hands later, as they are basically a sub-deck. To do so I'm going to just branch the constructor - if the populate option is set, then I'll fill the deck as new; if we provide an *args of cards, then we'll make an empty deck and add those cards to it. This logic can likely be made a little cleaner, but we can worry about that later. In the future we may want to make some changes here to the Deck class overall if we want it to be flexible and adaptable to different games. "

The primary thing we need to add to the Hand class to differentiate it from the Deck class is the ability to score itself. Each hand should be able to compute its value and compare to other hands, so we can determine winners. \n",

    "### Scoring Hands\n",
    "\n",
    "Scoring hands is something that we can likely implement in many ways. My method is going to be pretty simple, and I'm going to build it incrementally:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> Create a checkHands method that will check for whichever hands we have made the logic for, and return a value that we can use to compare. </li>\n",
    "<li> Create a method for each hand that we want to check for - pairs, straights, flushes, etc. </li>\n",
    "<li> In the __lt__ comparison, we can compare those values for sorting. </li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "This will allow us to make a scoring system that works and is more or less functional, just incomplete. I know that there are still several things I need to add to make it work correctly, but this starting point will work well enough for me to be able to test it out and develop the rest of the logic. In particular, I know I'm going to need to modify things to add:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> The rest of the hands that need to be checked. </li>\n",
    "<li> The ability to look at tie breakers, such as if two hands have the same pair, which has the higher kicker. </li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing I'm going to use to make some of the hand checking logic easier is a Counter. A Counter is a subclass of the dictionary class that is designed to count the number of times each element appears in a list. This will make it easy to check for pairs, three of a kind, and four of a kind."

    "We also need to modify the game class a little to deal with the new Player objects. I didn't have to make many changes, as the only thing that really changed is that now instead of each player being represented by a Hand in a list, each one is now represented by a Player object in a list. Our player can still just pass much of the logic down to its hand, like for sorting values and even most of the printing stuff. One change that I can think of is that the logic in starting the game needs to change - above the game generated hands in the constructor. In a real game, our players are created, then persist for many hands, so we probably want to put all the logic for dealing and scoring outside the constructor, as we want to call it over and over. \n",

For example, I probably want to make the Deck able to be inherited from, so that I can make a Deck for a different game, though I haven't thought through this yet. I also have the list of card ranks in more than one place now, I probably want to make that exist in only one place. As well, there's no tiebreaker logic in the scoring, and that needs special consideration, but can wait...\n",
