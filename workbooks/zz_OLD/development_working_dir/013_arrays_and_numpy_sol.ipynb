    "## Numpy Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "Numpy arrays are a data structure that is used to store data, and are largely similar to a list, though a more rigid one. Numpy arrays are used heavily in machine learning models, and are the data structure that is used to store the data that is actually passed into the models.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the most part, numpy arrays will work seamlessly in many of the functions that we use with other data structures. For example, the visualizations of data that we'll use through the machine learning work will make use of lists, series, arrays, or dataframes. \n",

    "### Arrays as a Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "The array is perhaps the most foundational data structure of all, and if we use more lower-level languages such as C, arrays are <i>the</i> data structure that we can use without importing any outside libraries. An array is structurally a lot like a list, but with a few key restrictions and differences:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> All elements of an array must be of the same type, whereas a list can contain elements of different types. </li>\n",
    "<li> Arrays are of a fixed size, whereas lists can grow and shrink. Array sizes are declared when created and can't change. </li>\n",
    "<li> The items in an array are mutable, we can modify any value inside an array. </li>\n",
    "<li> Arrays are stored in contiguous memory, whereas lists are not, or may not be. </li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "The final point is one that is mainly irrelevant when using an array in practice, but it is one that explains why arrays were so much more critical in older languages such as C than they are in new high-level languages such as Python. It also helps illustrate the difference between an array and a list, as well as the two types of languages. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Array Memory](../../images/array_memory.png \"Array Memory\")\n",
    "![Array Memory](../images/array_memory.png \"Array Memory\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Because an array is a fixed size, such as 100 integers, the computer can allocate a block of memory that is 100 integers long, and then store the array in that block of memory. This is what is meant by contiguous memory, the array is stored in a single block of memory. Since arrays never shrink or grow, as long as we have the address of the first element in the array, we can calculate the address of any element in the array. We also never need to worry about what happens if we need more space, as that's not possible. This definitive location in memory, leads to a few outcomes:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> First, this specific memory address was one of the building blocks of modern data structures such as a list - first adding indexing, then adding flexibility. Needing to manually manage memory is a lot of work, and avoiding doing so is one benefit of using a high-level language such as Python. </li>\n",
    "<li> Second, this is why arrays are so much faster than lists. If we want to access the 50th element of an array, we can calculate the memory address of that element and go directly to it. If we want to access the 50th element of a list, we have to start at the beginning of the list and iterate through it until we get to the 50th element. With a list we need to nagivate from item to item, and ensure we are going to the correct item; with an array, we know by definition where exactly every item is, so accessing each one is extremely fast. </li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Array Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "While the restrictions of an array make it less useful than something like a list in many cases, we do still have uses for it, primarily for the final datasets that we actually feed to machine learning models. Since the data we feed in always has consistent types as well as a fixed size, and we really care about efficiency if we have large data that is going to be repeatedly accessed, arrays are a good choice for this. In general, we can do most or all of the preparation of our data while it is stored in dataframes, and then convert it to arrays when we are ready to feed it into a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can make some simple arrays, though this step is actually a little more complex than creating a list or a dictionary - since an array needs to be a set size, we need to specify that size at creation. We can do this by passing in values to use in a list, or by using one of the functions to prefill an array with a specific value. We can also specify the type of the array, which we normally do implicitly, by filling it with some object. The types of arrays are the same as the types of variables, so we can have an array of integers, floats, strings, etc. For our purposes, we will virtually always use arrays of floats, as that is what we need to feed into machine learning models."

    "A multi-dimensional array is an array that has more than one dimension, and is also known as a matrix when there are two dimensions, and a tensor when there are three or more dimensions. Arrays that are in two or more dimensions are commonly used to create a data structure that mirrors a dataframe, or to encode the data for an image. \n",

    "### Multi-Dimensional Array Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "We can access items in a multi-dimensional array by specifying the index of each dimension, separated by commas. For example, if we have a two-dimensional array, we can access the item in the first row and second column by using the index [0, 1]. If we have a three-dimensional array, we can access the item in the first row, second column, and third dimension by using the index [0, 1, 2]. Row is the first digit, column the second, and \"depth\" or \"dimension\" the third."

    "### Slicing\n",
    "\n",
    "Like lists, we can slice arrays by their index. 2D arrays can be sliced by row, column, or both. 3D arrays can be sliced by row, column, depth, or any combination of the three. We can address the items in the array in two ways:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> By specifying the indicies separated by commas. </li>\n",
    "<li> By using a new [] for each dimension. </li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "These two are equivalent, we can use whatever is more convenient. Personally, I think the first is easier to manage when we have multiple dimensions or are doing elaborate slicing. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can also use the colon \":\" in a dimension to get all of the items in that dimension. For example, if we have a 2D array, we can use [0, :] to get all of the items in the first row, and [:, 0] to get all of the items in the first column. We can also use the colon to get a range of items, such as [0:2, 0:2] to get the first two rows and columns. As well, the -1 (or other negative) index can be used to get the last item, or items counting in from the end.\n",

    "The shape of an array is the number of elements in each dimension. For example, if we have a two-dimensional array that is 10 rows by 5 columns, the shape of the array is (10, 5). We can get the shape of an array by using the shape attribute, which is a tuple of the dimensions. We can also use the reshape function to change the shape of an array, which is useful when we want to convert a one-dimensional array into a multi-dimensional array, or when we want to change the shape of a multi-dimensional array.\n",

These functions are largely mathematical in nature, and are used to perform mathematical operations on arrays. The numpy array API page is located here https://numpy.org/doc/1.26/reference/arrays.ndarray.html and is a good reference, and a good reference page to practice referring to for more information. It is fairly clear and easy to read, and has examples. We won't focus on these different functions in detail at all, if we need one we should be able to look up what the function is and the details on how it works. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some common numpy functions include:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> np.zeros() - Creates an array of all zeros. </li>\n",
    "<li> np.ones() - Creates an array of all ones. </li>\n",
    "<li> np.full() - Creates an array of a specified size, filled with a specified value. </li>\n",
    "<li> np.random.random() - Creates an array of a specified size, filled with random values between 0 and 1. </li>\n",
    "<li> np.random.normal() - Creates an array of a specified size, filled with random values from a normal distribution with a specified mean and standard deviation. </li>\n",
    "<li> np.random.shuffle() - Shuffles the values in an array. </li>\n",
    "<li> np.random.seed() - Sets the random seed, so that random values are reproducible. </li>\n",
    "<li> np.arange() - Creates an array of a specified size, filled with a sequence of numbers. </li>\n",
    "<li> np.linspace() - Creates an array of a specified size, filled with a sequence of numbers that are evenly spaced between a specified minimum and maximum value. </li>\n",
    "<li> np.reshape() - Reshapes an array into a specified shape. </li>\n",
    "<li> np.concatenate() - Combines two arrays. </li>\n",
    "<li> np.split() - Splits an array into two arrays. </li>\n",
    "<li> np.transpose() - Transposes an array. </li>\n",
    "<li> np.dot() - Performs matrix multiplication on two arrays. </li>\n",
    "<li> np.sum() - Calculates the sum of an array. </li>\n",
    "<li> np.mean() - Calculates the mean of an array. </li>\n",

    "Many of these functions are equivalent to ones we used on dataframes or lists to get statistics from the data. Others, such as the ones to initialize an array or do actions like transpose or dot product, are commonly used in the innards of machine learning models - we will later look at using them inside a homemade neural network. These functions tend to be more efficient than their equivalents, so if we already have data in an array, using the built-in functions is preferable. "

    "#### Transpose\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the numpy functions that is commonly useful, largely outside of manipulating arrays is the transpose function. This returns a new array that is the transpose of the original array, which means that the rows become columns and the columns become rows. In calculating things, this is useful if we want to do something like average a row, or (how we'll see it later) perform operations between two arrays. It is also useful with some of the information functions, such as describe, especially if we have a large number of columns. The transpose function has a shortcut of T, so we can use array.T to transpose an array.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the describe example below, we can see that the results are now in a datasheet format, that is more useful if we want to do any kind of analysis or automated processing on the data."

    "The calendar itself should be stored in a 2D array, where each row represents a week, and each column represents a day of the week. The calendar should be initialized to have 0 meetings on every day. This means that the calendar should start life as a 2D array of 0s, with 6 rows and 7 columns. Every time a meeting is added, the value in the array should increase by 1. The purpose of this object is to act as a simple counter for the number of meetings in a day, and provide for simple related functions.\n",
