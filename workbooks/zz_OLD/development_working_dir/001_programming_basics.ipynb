    "# Programming Basics in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, and in data science in general, we'll predominantly use a programming language called \"Python\". Python is a flexible and popular programming language that is the most common language used in data science. In data science we most often use Python code wrapped inside. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Python, Notebooks, Code, Cells, and More\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a bit different from other languages you may have seen if you've programmed before such as C/C++ or Java in that it is \"interpreted\" rather than compiled, meaning that rather than taking the code we write and translating it into \"machine code\" (compilation) in one step, the python code is executed on the fly, step by step. This allows the Python code to run in what we are using here - a \"notebook\" file; a notebook \".ipynb\" file is basically like a webpage with python code and the output of that code embedded in it. Notebook files are the most common tool used to hold and execute our code in data science for a few reasons:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> We can look at data, code, and results all in one place, without leaving the page. This is useful as it helps us to explore and experiment quickly. </li>\n",
    "<li> We can run individual parts of our code independently without needing to wait for it all to be processed. <li>\n",
    "<li> We can make changes to our code easily and run multiple trials. </li>\n",
    "<li> We can present out output easily, and add context to help make it clear to others. </li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, in data science we are generally trying to gain insight into some data, the notebook format fits well into that process as it allows us an easy method to basically document the process we went through and display the results. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Blocks in Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Out notebooks are made up of blocks - markdown (text) and code. The markdown cells are cells like this, they are basically HTML web pages. The cell below is a code cell, we can click the play button beside it to run that block of code, and it will execute on its own, showing any output it generates below. If there's an error in our code, it'll print that out below as well; there will be a little green check and a time counter when things run successfully. "

    "\n",
    "Variables can be named almost anything you want, there are a few guidelines that will make it easier to manage though:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> Names should have some meaning - we want to be able to identify what a variable is, especially if others ever look at our code.</li>\n",
    "<li> It's common to shorten or abbreviate variable names, but it is probably a bad convention outside of extremely common ones from the outside world like rpm or b2c - even then, it's probably better to spell it out more. Modern coding tools, even the more basic non-AI based autocomplete type ones, are great at automatically filling in full variable names, so the advantage of being lazy is quickly disappearing. \n",
    "<li> Some varaible names have <i>default</i> usages that you'll get used to, it is a good idea to not overlap these names. A few of the really common ones are: \n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "    <li> X - features, or input values for predictive models.</li>\n",
    "    <li> Y - target, or what we want to predict in a predictive model.</li>\n",
    "    <li> Single letters (i, n, m, k, m, etc...) - often indexes or counters for position or looping. This will make more sense after the next ~3 workbooks.</li>\n",
    "    <li> df \n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "<li> There are several keywords which you can't use, and may or may not be banned from using in different cases. Things like lowercase true/false, def, etc...</li>\n",
    "<li> Names that come from other libraries (again, this will make more sense after a few workbooks) aren't banned, but overlapping names with functions that exist elsewhere and may or may not be imported into your code, can be confusing. For example, don't try to use names like pi or sqrt. </li>\n",

Some common types we'll deal with are:\n",

    "<li> Integer - a whole number (-2,-1,0,1,2...)</li>\n",
    "<li> Float - a decimal number (3.14, -23.2345, 0.04)</li>\n",
    "<li> Character - a letter, number, or puncuation (a, 3, #, ')</li>\n",
    "<li> String - text, a \"string\" of characters (\"my desk is cold\", \"bob\", \"apple\")</li>\n",
    "<li> Boolean - a True/False value. <b>Note:</b> True/False is normally directly mapped to 1/0; the two sets of values are often used interchangably and you should probably assume that they'll be interpreted interchangablly if you use them.</li>\n",
    "<li> List - a series of several variables. [12.4, 25.3, 34, 11] </li>\n",
    "<li> Tuple - a \"bundle\" of two or more other variables into one package. (49.2, 137.6) </li>\n",

    "## Objects and Viewing Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "One concept that we'll address in more detail later, but I want to introduce early, is the idea of an object, in the context of object-oriented programming. Read this now, if everything doesn't make sense, that's fine, we'll revisit it soon. This is a concept which is pretty simple... once it clicks for you. When you first start programming it will take a bit for it to click, and that \"bit\" is really variable from person to person. In short, the idea of object-oriented programming is that we create \"objects\" in the memory of our program, and the bulk of the program is those objects interacting with each other and being acted upon. For example, we can think of a simple version of a university, think of a system to track grades - a more simplified Moodle. There would be objects representing, roughly, each noun that we care about - student, class, class-offering, registration, instructor, etc... Each of these objects would be made up of a few things:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> Attributes - these are variables that hold information about the object. For example, the student object would have an attribute for name and birthdate, the class-offering object would have attributes for location and time. </li>\n",
    "<li> Methods - these are functions that the object can \"do\" or have done to it. For example, the class-offering object may have a \"reschudle\" function that updates that offerings time and place after checking for conflicts, or it may have a \"close course\" function that finalizes the grades and marks things to read-only. \n",
    "<li> Self - one important aspect is that objects are \"aware\" and can refer to them selves. There is an automatic \"self\" prefix that an object uses to refer to and act on it's own attributes and methods. For example, a class-offfering object can call self.description to update the attribute of the offering's description, or it can call it's self.reschedule() function to change when or where it is.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "A program is basically built up from creating instances, or individual examples, of the different types of objects that we need to model our scenario, then using the different methods to perform whichever actions need to be done. For a school, a bunch of students, courses, classes, and registrations are created with all their attributes, then their methods to register, withdraw, schedule, grade, etc... are called to go through the process of doing school. \n",
    "\n",
    "If it helps, we can kind of visualize the objects physically. We have a template of a generic student, class, and offering, and when one is created we instantiate, or create a new instance of the object from that template. These objects float around and interact with each other - a student object calls on a class-offering object's \"registerStudent\" function to create a registration object when they click on the web button to register. That function takes the student's info, the \"self\" info about the offering, checks to make sure there's no space or schedule conflicts, and calls on the constructor (a function that creates a new object) of the registration class to make that new registration object connecting the student and the class, and store that new registration object in the bucket with all the others. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we make simpler variables like strings and numbers, the same process is occurring - though for the built-in data types it is kind of obscured for convenience. Every time we make a string variable we are actually calling on the string class to make a new string object, and when we add to or subtract from it we are calling on it's functions to do the work on itself. We just don't notice because the language allows us to use strings without effort, because they are so common. One of the most common programming languages, C++, did not, at least when I learned it in school have built in strings - you would have to either import an outside library, or use the default of an array of characters. Python is way easier. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Viewing Current Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "We can view a list of the currently existing objects in the program's memory at any time by clicking the \"Variables\" button on the toolbar of VS Code. We get a list of all the objects that have been created to this point and their values. For simple things like integers, strings, even lists we'll see the actual value, for complex objects like a student in our fake school there will be lots of data and objects in objects in objects (e.g. a student could contain \"address\" objects, which in turn contain \"postal code*\" objects, which in turn contain strings), so the \"value\" column becomes less readable. These objects are all of the things that our program \"knows\", and each (mostly) line of code either adds to or does something to one the objects. Programming is just doing the correct action to the correct one of my objects in that variables list, that scales up to just having larger lists of larger numbers of items, but the concept is the same. \n",
    "\n",
    "In my experience learning how to code, really understanding this conceptually and being able to relate it to actual programming was a big step in code really making sense to me. \n",
    "\n",
    "\\* You may say, \"the postal code is just a string, why make another type of object for it?\" This is a good example of smart design to make things easier. If you had a normal string, you'd probably want to check if that was valid as a postal code, so you'd write a function to check it. If there was a postal code object, it would only allow valid postal codes to be created as it would check itself - this would mean that you never miss something in verifying a postal code and any changes are automatic. There could even be the ability to have the object check itself vs the street address provided to verify accuracy. We want to centralize actions in one location as much as possible almost all the time, which means we want to have objects that can \"handle themselves\" or do most things you may need to do with an object internally. Someone shouldn't be updating a postal code by grabbing the student object's \"postal code\" text field and typing in a new value; the update should happen by accessing the \"postal code\" object, asking it to run the \"update\" function with the new postal code as an input, which then makes sure that everything is ok and does all the work. No one needs to know anything about a postal code to use it, this makes it portable to other programs, and rather than having a million implementations of everything leading to inconsistencies and errors, we can have one object that does a thing, check that it works, then everyone can just borrow it. This is what we do when we import the common packages that we'll need for data science - pandas, sklearn, keras, etc... - there is a standardized implementation of \"accuracy\" that we know is correct, and we can just call it instead of calculating it.

In programming speak that leads us to the idea of <b>data structures</b>, or containers that hold many variables at once.

We can access items in a list by their index, which is their position in the list. We can also add items to a list, remove items from a list, and do other things to manipulate the list. In Python, lists are denoted by square brackets [] and items are separated by commas. We can reference a specific item by using it's index in a square bracket after the list name - e.g. my_list[3] will return the 4th item in the list, as the 4th item is at position 3. \n",

    "Most data structures that have positions, like our list, are \"0 indexed\", which just means that the first position is position 0. This is in contrast to something that is \"1 indexed\", where the first item is item #1, like you might count in normal life. This isn't universal, but it is close to it, so the first item is (pretty much) always item #0. Extending from this, the last item will be \"length - 1\", as our list of 4 items has things in positions 0, 1, 2, and 3. We can ask for the length using the len() function. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Note:</b> there are other ways to get each item from a list that will be used more later as they are more efficient. The idea of accessing things via an index is transferable to lots of programming-ish topics and is really critical. "

    "### Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples are a data structure that is similar to a list, but with a few key differences. Tuples are denoted by parentheses () instead of square brackets. The main difference is that tuples are immutable, meaning that once they are created they cannot be changed. This is useful for things like coordinates, where we want to make sure that the x and y values don't change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples are often used when we want to \"package\" a few values together, especially when we want to return multiple values from a function. Accessing values from a tuple is the same as a list, we just use the index to get the value. "
