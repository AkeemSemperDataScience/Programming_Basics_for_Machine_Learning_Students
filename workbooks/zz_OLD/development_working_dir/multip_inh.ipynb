    "Just like in real life, an object can be a child of multiple parents, for example, a 'Student' can be a child of 'Person' and 'Learner'. This is called multiple inheritance. Multiple inheritance isn't conceptually all that different from single inheritance, but it does have some interesting properties. Let's take a look at an example.\n",

Finally, we have a class called 'Student' which inherits from both 'Person' and 'Learner'. This means that 'Student' has access to all of the attributes and methods of both 'Person' and 'Learner'.

Well, it turns out that Python has a way of determining which method to use. It uses something called the Method Resolution Order (MRO). The MRO is the order in which Python will look for a method. We can use the built-in 'super' function to see the MRO. Let's take a look at an example.\n",
