    "# Conditional Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional statements are what allow us to introduce logic into our programs, so we can tell them to do different things in different scenarios. Conditionals are the basis of all computer programs, and are what allow us to make decisions in our programs and do different things based on the input we receive.\n",
    "\n",
    "## If Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important words in computer science is \"if\", which allows us to make a conditional statement. An if statement is a command that allows us to:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> Ask some question.</li>\n",
    "<li> Do one thing if it is true.</li>\n",
    "<li> Do something else if it is false.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "This concept allows computer programs to be more useful than just a set of automated instruction, and we can stack several if statements (along with other logic commands), to make a program capable of doing almost anything we desire. \n",

    "\n",
    "### Writing If Statements and Indentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing an \"If\" is simple, we just need to match the syntax. This leads us into one of the most important concepts in Python, which is indentation. Indentation is the way we tell Python that a line of code is part of a block of code. In other programming languages, indentation is optional, but in Python it is required. In short, we need to keep things indented to tell Python what parts of code \"belong to\" something else. In our conditional statements the indentation separates what is done if the condition is true from the rest of the code. The indentation is equivalent to braces or brackets in other languages or even Excel formulas; in Python we don't need brackets, we just need to indent the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the concepts that we'll look at soon will also require indentation, so it's important to get used to it now. Functions, classes, loops, etc... will all need us to keep our code indented at the proper level. "

In the first example, we mix one of the cases (<=0) with the \"bad input\" case, which is not ideal as we can't differentiate between the two.

    "\n",
    "One important thing to take note of now, that will be more important for you later on is to not use literals, or hard coded values, in your conditions. For example, the 10 in the condition above is a bad idea. This general concept holds true for almost all programming, we don't want static values hard coded into the logic of our programs. It would be much better to have a variable that holds the number 10, then use that variable in our code. There are several reasons for this, but the most important is that it makes our code more flexible. If we want to change the value of 10, we only need to change it in one place, rather than every place that it is used. This is a key concept in programming, and is something that we will see over and over again. Having hard coded values littered throughout a program can make things a nightmare to debug should there be an error, as it is very easy to miss one somewhere. \n",
    "\n",
    "A better approach would be to use a variable, and then change the value of that variable if we need to. For constants, or things that likely won't change throughout the execution of the program, a common convention is to use all capital letters for the variable name. This is a convention, not a rule, but it is something that you will see in a lot of code. We may often see a stack of these constants near the top of a program, so that they are easy to find and change if needed. When we get to machine learning stuff, we'll commonly use this to set things like limits on how many times we want something to happen or settings that we input to certain functions - this way we can change things that apply across the entire program in one spot.

    "#### Testing and Edge Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional operations, particularly ones with complex logic, are a prime candidate for introducing a bug into your code. The most likely place to have an error are the edge cases, or things along the limits of what can happen. For our simple number comparisons we'd want to test things like if numbers are equal to ensure it works as expected. We'd also want to make sure we test each correct scenario, when the tested number is lower than both, higher than both, and in the middle. For complex conditional logic this can expand to a pretty large number of potential cases to test, it is worth it to do so in most cases because these are the places where errors are likely to happen, and with things like this it may work perfectly for long periods of time until you get some unlikely edge case that fails or seems correct but has the wrong result.\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes an edge case is highly situation dependent, but we probably want to ensure we test things at either side and equal to limits, empty values, 0 or negative values, incorrect data (e.g. letters in a phone number), equality in conditionals, repeated values, empty lists, or whatever else might be used in a logical statement in code. It's common for production software development have a test harness that is automatically run any time some portion of the code is updated. For example, if some programmer is working on some code that calculates grade point averages in our school example, when they submit their updates to be added to the main program, a series of tests may run to calculate some GPAs and some edge cases - GPA for no classes, average of 0, average over 4, \"IP\" (in progress, used if someone is given extra time after the end of a semester, like if they have surgery on Dec 1) to ensure the result was ok for all these things that might happen. \n",
