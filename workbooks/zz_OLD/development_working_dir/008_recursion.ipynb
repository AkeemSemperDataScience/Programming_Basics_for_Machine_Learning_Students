This problem isn't super complex to solve, first let's create a loop to solve it iteratively."

This is a very simple example, but it shows the basic structure of a recursive function. At the first call the n value is 5, so the answer is 5 * factorial(4) so the function calls itself with 4. At the second call the n value is 4, so the answer to this call is 4 * factorial(3) and it calls itself with 3... Eventually the final call is 1, so it returns 1 for recursionFactorial(1), which is multiplied by 2 and passed up the chain as the answer of 2 to recursionFactorial(2), which is multipled by 3 and becomes the answer to recursionFactorial(3)... and so on until the final answer is returned."

    "\n",
    "Recursion is a very powerful technique, but it is not always the best solution. In general, recursion is best used when the problem can be broken down into a series of smaller problems that are solved in the same way. It is also useful when the problem can be solved by solving a smaller version of the same problem. For example, the factorial of 5 is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1, but the factorial of 4 is 4 * 3 * 2 * 1. The factorial of 4 is a smaller version of the factorial of 5, so we can use the same logic to solve both problems.\n",

    "Recursion is not always the best solution. It can be difficult to understand, and it can be difficult to debug. It can also be less efficient than an iterative solution. In general, if you can solve a problem iteratively, you should. If you can't, then you should consider using recursion.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recursion and the Stack\n",
    "\n",
    "One potential concern when using recursive calls is the stack. Each time a function is called, the computer needs to allocate memory to store the variables and other information for that function. This memory is allocated on the stack, which is a special area of memory that is used to store information about the current state of the program. When a function is called, the computer allocates memory on the stack for that function. When the function returns, the computer frees the memory on the stack. If a function calls itself recursively, the computer needs to allocate memory on the stack for each call. If the function calls itself too many times, the computer may run out of memory on the stack. This is known as a stack overflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have a recursive function that does many calculations, with lots of variables, for a large number of iterations, this can be an issue. In most cases, it is pretty unlikely that we'll encounter this issue all that much, but it is something that we should consider. When we get to dealing with large data sets for machine learning, if we have a recursive function that is doing something for every record in our data, it may be easy to create thousands or even millions of recursive calls.
