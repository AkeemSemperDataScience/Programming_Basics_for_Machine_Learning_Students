    "# Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to conditional statements, loops are another critical building block of programming. Loops allow us to repeat code over and over, to do things like add 10% to all the prices in our web store, or to combine the first and last names from two lists of people into \"last, first\" format. \n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea of a loop is that we do something over and over again, until some limit or stop condition is reached. This can be used to do something to every item in a list, perform an operation a pre-determined number of times, or to keep doing something until some condition is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Loop Components\n",
    "\n",
    "Every loop has a few key components:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> Condition - this is the logical test that will be checked each time through the loop to figure out if we should stop or keep going. </li>\n",
    "<li> Body - the body of the loop is the code you want to keep repeating. </li>\n",
    "<li> Index - where you \"are\" in whatever you're looping through. </li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Loop Types\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several types of loop that are common - for the most part they are interchangeable, though potentially with some modifications. \"While\" and \"for\" are probably the most common and widely used. \n",
    "\n",
    "### While Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "A while loop will keep repeating the body \"while\" the condition remains true. So it will first check the condition, if true do the body, if false the loop is complete, repeat until the condition is false. \n",
    "\n",
    "At some point in the loop, usually at the end of the body, we increment the index. The easiest way to picture a loop is that you're progressing through a series of items in a list, after we're done with each one we advance our place to the next. \n",

In those cases, we need to be cautious about anything that goes through all the data using nested loops, as we may end up with 1,000,000 * 1,000,000 executions if we are not careful."

    "\n",
    "This is a basic introduction to some simple techniques, debugging code is a big topic and will likely be your main source of frustration as you learn. These techniques are some of the most simple things we can do, and they are still useful and easy in many cases as things get more complex. \"Real\" larger scale debugging often uses debug tools that provide a more sophisticated version of this stuff, but learning those tools requires some effort. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Separating Code Blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing that the notebook files make very easy is to separate code into separate blocks, so we can run little chunks independently. If we have an error we are trying to diagnose, one easy first step is to break up our code into smaller bits, so we can run them one by one to try to identify which line is causing the error. Since our code is basically line after line of creating and changing variable values, we can look at those values manually and try to see where one becomes incorrect. \n",

    "### VS Code Variable Viewer\n",
    "\n",
    "When using VS Code we have access to a useful tool that allows us to see a list of our variables and their values. There is a button in the toolbar labeled \"varaibles\" that will open a little window that allows us to see our varaible values. If we run our code block by block, we can see the variables change in the little window, hopefully noticing where the mistake occurs. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Regular Print Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "An even more direct way to find errors is to embed print statements that tell us some useful info as our code executes, usually indicators of where we are in the code, or what a varaible is at that point. This is especially useful in loops - we can print out values, indexes, before/after notices, etc... that let us have a version of a log of the changes as we go through the loop. Again, we want to try to find where there is a mistake. \n",

In many later and/or more advanced examples we may see less and less explicit looping code, but that is because we are using more advanced tools that are doing the looping for us. These changes are normally done to make our code more efficient, but the underlying logic is still the same. We'll revisit this, but I just want you to be aware if there are examples out on the internet that are \"missing\" their loops. "
