# Order Changes

All, you may have noticed we did a bit of a rearrange of the order of some of the workbooks in the teens. This was done to, hoepfully, make it a little easier on you all. The reordering isn't all that ippactful overall, but we made changes as follows:

<b>Old Order:</b>
<ul>
<li> 14 - Map and Apply </li>
<li> 15 - Overloading </li>
<li> 16 - File Management 2 (pandas). This was done when we did file access initially. </li>
<li> 17 - Args and kwargs. This was done earlier. </li>
<li> 17a - Inheritance. </li>
<li> 18 - Card Game Exercise/Example. </li>
</ul>

<b>New Order:</b>
<ul>
<li> Previous - args and kwargs, and files are completed. </li>
<li> 14 - Map and Apply </li>
<li> 15 - Overloading and Inheritance </li>
<li> 17 - Card Game Exercise/Example. </li>
</ul>

Renaming so many files tends to cause merge issues with everyone updating them, so I left the names as is for now.
