    "# File Access\n",
    "\n",
    "In data science we are almost always going to be connecting to some file or database to get some data. In python code we can access files or other resources by loading in a library that \"knows\" how to communicate with the underlying computer, then asking it to read or write what we want to access. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are libraries written to handle many different types of data in Python such as PDFs, Excel files, and database extracts. The most common thing we'll be using is a CSV - comma separated value - file, a CSV is more or less an Excel table without any formatting or \"smarts\", just the raw data. "

    "## User Inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "User input is a minor concern for us in most areas of data science, but it is easy to capture some simple user input. The `input` function will prompt the user for some input, and then return that input as a string. We can then use that string in our program. The input function can take an argument, which is the prompt that the user will see. The input reacts differently in a 'regular' python file (.py) versus a notebook file - and it can be different depending on the editor used (VS Code for our case). In a .py python file, the prompt is just a standard command line; in VS Code it will pop up a little text entry window near the top of the page. Once the input is captured, it is the same in either environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Interacting with users in other ways, generally though some interface like a GUI, is a little more complex and requires use of some framework to kisckstart (or a lot of work to build from scratch). \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Note:</b> capturing outside data, like from a user, is one place where we want to focus extra attention on data validation, or ensuring that what we captured is what we wanted. We can't necessarily trust that the user will give us what we expect, so we need to be prepared to handle unexpected inputs. If we are interacting with user provided inputs in a production environment we want to ensure that the data we read is valid, of the right format, and that it doesn't contain any malicious code (like an SQL injection attack targeted at webapps). For our purposes, we will mostly assume that inputs are reasonable, unless specified. "

    "Just like a spreadsheet, the dataframe values can be accessed by row and column. We can use the `iloc` function to access the values by row and column number, or the `loc` function to access the values by row and column name. Note that the `iloc` function is zero based, so the first row is row 0, the second row is row 1, etc. The `loc` function is one based, so the first row is row 1, the second row is row 2, etc. The order of the rows in our dataframe is both critical and irrelevant - the data generally isn't in any particular order, so something being in row 1 or row 1,000,000 makes no difference; at the same time, when we do machine learning work later, we normally trust that the order is fixed, so row 1 is always row 1, and row 1,000,000 is always row 1,000,000. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Note:</b> we <i>can</i> address things by their coordinates in the dataframe, but it isn't often something we really want to do. We won't spend a lot of time or effort dealing with the data in this way, but it's good to know that it's possible.

The first? The last? The average? The sum? The max? The min? It doesn't make sense to group by a column and then show the values in another column without some aggregation. We can provide the aggregation functions as a dictionary, and whatever is in there will be calculated. Each key/value pair is the name of the column, along with the calculation we want. "

    "The CSV filetype is by far the most commonly used for small scale data science work, but we do commonly use other file types. Pandas itself is pretty capable and can handle lots of similar file types, most notably Excel files. The Panda's documentation has a list of the file types it can handle here: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Note:<b> in most production environments we will probably use a connection to a database rather than load a file. The concepts are almost identical, we'd just replace the \"read_csv\" part that we used here with a similar command(s) to grab the desired data from the database. With larger scale examples such as neural networks, that still holds - rather than making datasets from the data in our file, we would make them from our database connection. Once we have the data in our program, it doesn't matter where it came from. In fact, we can replace the \"load some data\" part of most of the code we write with some other chunk of code that loads the data from somewhere else, and the rest of the code will work the same."

When we get to working on large datasets to create neural networks, there are other libraries which perform the same functionality for us, but are better suited to handling large datasets efficiently. Each method relies on importing some library that has been written to act as a \"bridge\" between Python and the underlying computer. Pandas has this as part of it's functionality. \n",

The OS library is part of the standard Python library, so we don't need to install anything to use it. Each call to an OS function is like a request to the underlying operating system to do something. For example, we can ask it to list the files in our data directory:"

Calls like this to interact with the computer are much more common in other types of programming, such as if you were making an application with a UI. In data science we are mainly focused on just grabbing some data, then we do all of our work inside our program, so we don't need to interact with the computer much. This also has the advantage of making our programs fairly portable, as we'll see later when we use Colab to run our code in the cloud."

    "## Installing Things and Magic Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "We can install libraries from within our notebook using the `!pip install` command. This is a \"magic\" command, which is a special command that is only available in Jupyter notebooks. The `!` at the beginning of the command tells the notebook that this is a magic command, and not a normal Python command. The `pip` command is the Python package manager, which is a program that knows how to download and install Python libraries. The `install` command is the command that tells pip to install something. The `pandas` part is the name of the library that we want to install.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also do this from the command line, which is the 'normal' way to do it when using our computers. What this magic command can do for us is to help make it easy to run our code anywhere, such as Colab on the cloud. If we install the libraries we need from within our notebook, then we can run the notebook anywhere and it will have everything it needs to run. For the most part, the things we use in data science are pretty common, so it is unlikely that we'll try to install anything that can't be found. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Note:</b> the <b><i>pip</i></b> program itself is something that needs to be installed. There is a magic command to install it in the example below, since we installed Anaconda already we can use the <b><i>conda</i></b> program to install pip. You may or may not need to do this, if you installed Anaconda you probably already have pip installed. I'd run the 'conda' command from a command line if you need to use it, it may ask for confirmation before installing. To open a prompt, go to Terminal->New Terminal in VS Code and a new terminal window will open. "
