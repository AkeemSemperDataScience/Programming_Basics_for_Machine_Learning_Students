## Self Testing

You can run pytest tests on your machine using the command `pytest -v` in the root directory of the repository. To open a terminal in the root directory, you can right-click on the root directory and select `Open in Integrated Terminal`.

Type the pytest command in the terminal and press Enter. This command will run everything in the test_asn1.py file - each function is a test. You can add to and change the tests in the test_asn1.py file, and that's a good idea to add to as you progress.
